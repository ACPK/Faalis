** TODO Add a feature which each field can be a collection of a resource parent field.
   for example we can define a field with type of  "collection" and "to" value of "Author.books"
   and current resource is a child of "Author" resource. So this field will render as a combobox
   and it will contains all the books of current author.

** TODO add a feature to dashboard generatores which allow some fields value to depend on other field values
** TODO update copyright to 2014

* Features
** TODO Resource Groups
   Resource group is an entity which collect some initial data for a group
   of resources. For example a Resource group will contains all the necessary
   permissions to work with those resource group.
*** Implementation
    To implement such functionality we need to add a directory like `app/`
    and add that to `autoload` pathes so rails can autoload any group by
    reference. Then we need to autodiscovery hook to find all resource
    groups in migration time `just like the one in mode_discovery` gem.
    This way we can list all groups easily in runtime and load what ever
    we want using Rails autoload.
