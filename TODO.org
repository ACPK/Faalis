** DONE override *find_resource* in *APIController*
   So our api can response to requests with filter data. For example "/api/v1/posts?title_contains=example"
   https://github.com/ryanb/cancan/blob/440bd887008820efbee8b954790f79b48d8264a6/lib/cancan/controller_resource.rb#L103
** TODO Add json field options to field data strcuture in javascript file when type == "in"
** TODO Add a feature which each field can be a collection of a resource parent field.
   for example we can define a field with type of  "collection" and "to" value of "Author.books"
   and current resource is a child of "Author" resource. So this field will render as a combobox
   and it will contains all the books of current author.
** TODO add an ability to categorize fields of an scaffold to fieldsets
** TODO add a feature to dashboard generatores which allow some fields value to depend on other field values
** TODO use groupify gem instead of current group functionality
* Features
** DONE Edit Profile
** DONE User messages
** DONE add mailboxer
** DONE User should can select items of result for controller api by GET
** TODO Resource Groups
   Resource group is an entity which collect some initial data for a group
   of resources. For example a Resource group will contains all the necessary
   permissions to work with those resource group.
*** Implementation
    To implement such functionality we need to add a directory like `app/`
    and add that to `autoload` pathes so rails can autoload any group by
    reference. Then we need to autodiscovery hook to find all resource
    groups in migration time `just like the one in mode_discovery` gem.
    This way we can list all groups easily in runtime and load what ever
    we want using Rails autoload.
