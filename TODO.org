* Features
** TODO Resource Groups
   Resource group is an entity which collect some initial data for a group
   of resources. For example a Resource group will contains all the necessary
   permissions to work with those resource group.
*** Implementation
    To implement such functionality we need to add a directory like `app/`
    and add that to `autoload` pathes so rails can autoload any group by
    reference. Then we need to autodiscovery hook to find all resource
    groups in migration time `just like the one in mode_discovery` gem.
    This way we can list all groups easily in runtime and load what ever
    we want using Rails autoload.
