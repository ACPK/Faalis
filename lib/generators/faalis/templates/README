Steps to finish up installation:

  1. Ensure you have defined default url options in your environments files. Here
     is an example of default_url_options appropriate for a development environment
     in config/environments/development.rb:

       config.action_mailer.default_url_options = { :host => 'localhost:3000' }

     In production, :host should be set to the actual host of your application.

  2. You can override your root controller through Faalis::HomeController class.

  3. Ensure you have flash messages in app/views/layouts/application.html.erb.
     Only if you want to change the layout

     For example:

       <p class="notice"><%= notice %></p>
       <p class="alert"><%= alert %></p>

  4. Create a javascript manifest in 'app/assets/javascripts/dashboard/application.js'
     and require 'faalis/dashboard/application.js'.

     NOTE: You can change the default manifest name and path via 'config.dashboard_js_manifest'
           in 'config/initializers/faalis.rb'.

  5. Make sure you take a look and configured conf/initializer/devise.rb

     NOTE: if you want to use devise with omniauth configure them in
           conf/initializer/devise.rb according to devise wiki

  6. Make sure you take a look and configured conf/initializer/fast_gettext.rb
  7. Make sure you take a look and configured conf/initializer/formtastic.rb
  8. Add your resources to routes.rb like this:

       namespace :api, :defaults => {:format => :json} do
           namespace :v1 do
              resources :resource
           end
       end
