Steps to finish up installation:

  1. Ensure you have defined default url options in your environments files. Here
     is an example of default_url_options appropriate for a development environment
     in config/environments/development.rb:

       config.action_mailer.default_url_options = { :host => 'localhost:3000' }

     In production, :host should be set to the actual host of your application.

  2. Migrate your database and run `db:seed` too. For example:

     $ rake db:migrate db:seed

  4. Make sure you take a look and configured conf/initializer/devise.rb (optional)

     NOTE: if you want to use devise with omniauth configure them in
           conf/initializer/devise.rb according to devise wiki

  5. Make sure you take a look and configured conf/initializer/formtastic.rb (optional)
